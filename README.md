Thoughts about the code.

In my opinion there are a lot of unnecessary variable declaration on the code and its hard to follow what is going on with this feature.

I think the code can be improved by using Laravel helpers method specially in the arrays or collection, using better Eloquent queries and also by formatting the code in to more readable fashion so that other developers can understand each function

For the BookingRepository the code is more than 2 thousand lines of codes. 
we can refactor this by creating methods are can be reused on other file.

Finally I can say that its not terrible but its still needs improvement.
